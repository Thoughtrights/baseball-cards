# baseball-cards

Simple but decent presentation of a JSON file of baseball card data.

Unfortunately obtaining updated market values for cards is locked
behind paywall APIs. But that's okay because value is primarily
limited to graded cards. Grading is a monopolized business.

Oh. Apologies for all the .jpgs if you're looking to reuse this. You
probably have your own cards in your own safety deposit box. ;-)
